# U-Boot for Pine64 on FreeBSD

This repository contains a simple Makefile for building U-Boot for Pine64 on
a FreeBSD host.  It largely follows the instructions at:

https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image/tree/master/u-boot-postprocess

This is intended as a turn-key clone-and-build, and contains a few
modifications from the upstream instructions to build on FreeBSD.
